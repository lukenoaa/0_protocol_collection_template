## BACKGROUND

This document describes the required protocol to conduct insert name of the method/protocol.

### Summary

Insert a short description of the background for the method/protocol (e.g. why and for which purpose do you perform water sampling).
Please provide a brief summary of your method including, as appropriate, a brief description of what techniques your best practice is about, which ocean environments or regions it targets, the primary sensors covered, what type of data/measurements/observing platform it covers, limits to its applicability.

### Method Description and Rationale

Insert a short description of the functioning principal of the methodology used in the protocol (i.e. how does the method work?). Please note that this is different from the step-by-step description of the protocol procedure.
Insert a short statement explaining why the specific methodology used in the protocol has been selected (e.g. it is highly reproducible, highly accurate, procedures are easy to execute etc….).

### Spatial Coverage and Environment(s) of Relevance

If applicable, please specify the region where the protocol is applied. For regional term guidance see here. If applicable, please indicate here the environment(s) of relevance for the protocol, e.g. Abyssal plain. Select from the ENVO terminology.

## PERSONNEL REQUIRED

Insert the number of technicians, data managers, and scientists required for the good execution of the procedure

### Safety

Identify hazards associated with the procedure and specify protective equipment and safety training required to safely execute the procedure

### Training Requirements

Specify technical training required for the good execution of the procedure.

### Time Needed to Execute the Procedure

Specify how much time is necessary to execute the procedure.

## EQUIPMENT, SOFTWARE & PACKAGES

- Description: E.g., "laptop".
- Product Name and Model: Provide the official name of the product.
- Manufacturer: Provide the name of the manufacturer of the product.
- Quantity: Provide quantities necessary for one application of the standard operating procedure.
- Remark: For example, laptops may need a minimmum number of gigabytes of RAM to run the protocol correctly.

## Guide to Archived Methodology

The contents of this archive should allow your analysis to be reproduced exactly as you intended it.

This document provides guidance on the contents of each partner's compressed archive of in-silico methods. This document should be part of that same archive, serving as an extended README.

Below, please find guidance on what this archive should include. When describing the contents of the archive, please give precise file names and relative paths to the files.

### Archive content

To reproduce the in-silico analysis, please provide one of the following (in order of decreasing preference)

1. Jupyter, R notebook(s) or equivalents

2. Downloaded archive of (the released version of) your github repository

3. Individual scripts

In each of the above cases, guidance and documentation for all the steps you took to perform the in-silico analysis should be included. In case 1., code and documentation are integrated. In cases 2. and 3., in-line comments may be provided, however, these are not generally sufficient as documentation. In those cases, please provide a step-by-step protocol on how and when to run each script in the Execution Procedure section below.

Please include a script on **data acquisition** (e.g. documentation and code to pull sequences from INSDC, access sequences on an institutional FTP server, download metadata files, check file integrity via md5 checksum). Please add sufficient detail, so that the partners only have to install the software, run this script and will then have all the data needed to perform any analysis described below.

### Code
Here please describe each file containing code, including its purpose, its input, its output. Please provide the names and the relative paths to this documentation.

### Code documentation
Here, please indicate if your documentation is with the code (in a code notebook) or stored separately. In-line comments are not considered documentation. If the documentation is stored separately, please provide the names and the relative paths to this documentation.

### Metadata
Please provide link(s) to the files containing metadata about your sequence data (e.g. environmental data, procedural data). Please see the MIxS compliant metadata guidance.

Auxiliary files
e.g. mapping files, test/dummy files, colour palette

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

Please fill out this section if you have not already documented it as part of your R, Jupyter, or similar notebook. In this section, please provide a step-by-step guidance on how and when to run each component of your code.

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]

### Quality control

Describe and explain criteria used to validate results of the standard operating procedure.

### Basic Troubleshooting Guide

- Identify known issues associated with the procedure, if any.
- Provide troubleshooting guidelines when available.

## REFERENCES

- Insert all references cited in the document.
- Please insert full DOI address when available, e.g. http://doi.dx.org/10.1007/s11258-014-0404-1

## APPENDIX A: DATASHEETS
